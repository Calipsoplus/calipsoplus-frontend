    "name": "ALBA Light Source",
    "description": "ALBA is a 3rd generation Synchrotron Light facility located in Cerdanyola del Vallès, (Barcelona), being the newest source in the Mediterranean area. It is a complex of electron accelerators to produce synchrotron light, which allows the visualization of the atomic structure of matter as well as the study of its properties.  The 3 GeV electron beam energy at ALBA is achieved by combining a LInear ACcelerator (LINAC) and a low-emittance, full-energy BOOSTER placed in the same tunnel as the STORAGE RING. ALBA's 270 meter perimeter has 17 straight sections all of which are available for the installation of insertion devices",

    "name": "DESY",
    "description": "DESY is one of the world’s leading accelerator centres. Researchers use the large-scale facilities at DESY to explore the microcosm in all its variety – from the interactions of tiny elementary particles and the behaviour of new types of nanomaterials to biomolecular processes that are essential to life. The accelerators and detectors that DESY develops and builds are unique research tools. The facilities generate the world’s most intense X-ray light, accelerate particles to record energies and open completely new windows onto the universe. ?That makes DESY not only a magnet for more than 3000 guest researchers from over 40 countries every year, but also a coveted partner for national and international cooperations. Committed young researchers find an exciting interdisciplinary setting at DESY. The research centre offers specialized training for a large number of professions. DESY cooperates with industry and business to promote new technologies that will benefit society and encourage innovations. This also benefits the metropolitan regions of the two DESY locations, Hamburg and Zeuthen near Berlin.",

    "name": "Diamond Light Source",
    "description": "Diamond Light Source is the UK’s national synchrotron. It works like a giant microscope, harnessing the power of electrons to produce bright light that scientists can use to study anything from fossils to jet engines to viruses and vaccines. The machine accelerates electrons to near light speeds so that they give off light 10 billion times brighter than the sun. These bright beams are then directed off into laboratories known as ‘beamlines’. Here, scientists use the light to study a vast range of subject matter, from new medicines and treatments for disease to innovative engineering and cutting-edge technology.",

    "description": "Energy materials comprise more than just solar cells. Energy materials also include solar fuels, thermoelectrics, and topological insulators. These are materials that store or convert energy, or enable construction of new energy-efficient information technologies like spintronics. Scientists at HZB are researching these kinds of systems of materials, always with the emphasis on thin-film technologies. We are able to build on the know-how we already acquired in the area of thin-film photovoltaics and that HZB research is known for internationally. Now we are combining the outstanding means of analysis offered in particular at BESSY II and BER II with expanded expertise in materials synthesis, as well as in the field of simulation and theory. Especially interesting research advances at HZB are presented in our annual reports and highlights and through our Research Highlights web pages. You can learn more about the research programmes.",
